# Gemini-Code-Reviewer-Explainer
A responsive web application frontend built with React that allows users to submit code snippets for intelligent analysis via an LLM backend (such as Google Gemini or OpenAI GPT). Users can choose different modes‚Äîcode review, explanation, test case suggestions, and optimization‚Äîto get tailored AI-powered feedback and insights in real-time.
Based on the React code you shared for your Gemini Code Reviewer & Explainer web application, and the style of the AI Medical Assistant README you provided as a sample, here is a professional, clear, and well-structured README file tailored for your project. This README follows similar sections and tone to your sample for consistency and ease of onboarding users and developers.

# Gemini Code Reviewer & Explainer

A React-based frontend web application paired with an LLM-powered backend that helps developers review, explain, optimize, and generate test cases for their code snippets using advanced AI language models like Google Gemini or OpenAI GPT.

***

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Modes:** Choose from code review, explanation, test case suggestions, or code optimization powered by an intelligent AI backend.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Responsive and user-friendly React UI optimized for smooth developer experience.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Receive instant, AI-generated insights on your code.
- **Easy Integration:** Communicates with your backend API over HTTP for flexible deployment.
- **Support for Large Code Inputs:** Handles multi-line code snippets comfortably.

***

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (for running React app)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Backend API running locally or remotely providing `/analyze` POST endpoint
- Compatible AI API key configured in backend (e.g., Google Gemini API or OpenAI API)

***

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone 
cd 
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
_or_

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Frontend Application

```bash
npm start
```
_or_

```bash
yarn start
```

The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend API Requirements

The frontend expects a backend running on `http://localhost:5000` with a POST endpoint `/analyze` that accepts JSON:

```json
{
  "code": "",
  "mode": ""
}
```

It returns a JSON with the AI's result:

```json
{
  "result": ""
}
```

Make sure your backend:

- Allows cross-origin requests from the frontend
- Handles different `mode` values by configuring language model prompts accordingly
- Communicates with Google Gemini or OpenAI GPT API to generate responses

***

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Paste or type your code into the text area.
2. Select the desired analysis mode (Review, Explain, Suggest Test Cases, or Optimize).
3. Click the **Submit** button.
4. View the AI-generated response displayed below the form.

***

## üí° Extending the Project

- Add authentication for user accounts.
- Support file uploads for larger codebases.
- Integrate streaming responses for real-time result updates.
- Extend backend with more granular AI prompt customization.
- Develop a backend admin panel to manage API keys and usage.

***

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **CORS errors:** Ensure your backend has appropriate CORS headers to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Empty or error responses:** Check backend logs and API key validity.
- **Slow performance:** Adjust AI model parameters or upgrade backend hardware.
